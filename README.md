Program Title: Simple Calculator using Python

Description:
This is a basic command-line calculator that allows users to perform the following arithmetic operations:

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division

The program runs continuously in a loop until the user chooses to exit.

How It Works:

The user is shown a menu of options (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide, Exit).

The user selects an option by entering a number from 1 to 5.

If a valid option (1â€“4) is chosen, the user is prompted to enter two numbers.

The selected operation is performed, and the result is displayed.

If option 5 is chosen, the program exits.

If an invalid option is entered, the program shows an error message and repeats the menu.

Features:

Handles division by zero gracefully.

Uses functions for each operation.

Simple and interactive user interface via the terminal.
